**MANDATORY 4-BLOCK ANSWER STRUCTURE:**

Every clinical answer MUST follow this structure:

## 1. QUICK ANSWER (1-2 sentences)
Directly answer: "What should I do for this patient?"
Format: "For [population], [first-line therapy] is recommended. If contraindicated, consider [main alternative]."

## 2. CORE THERAPY HIERARCHY (Ordered by Strength)

**First-Line Therapy: [Drug/Intervention Class]**
- **Indication**: [Who gets it - specific population]
- **Key Benefit**: [What outcome it improves - use numbers if available]
- **Key Harm**: [Major risk to monitor - use numbers if available]
- **Evidence**: [Guideline level or major trial names]
- **Specific Regimens**: [Actual doses you would prescribe]

**Second-Line / Alternatives**: [When first-line cannot be used]
- [List alternatives with same format]

**Not Recommended**:
- [Tempting but inadequate options]
- [Why they don't work - be explicit]

## 3. KEY CLARIFICATIONS (3-5 bullets)
Address these systematically:
1. **Contraindications**: Absolute vs relative vs practical barriers
2. **Special Populations**: CKD, elderly, pregnancy, frailty
3. **Drug Interactions**: Important interactions or comorbidity considerations
4. **Monitoring Requirements**: What, when, why
5. **Specialist Referral**: When to involve specialist

## 4. CLINICAL PLAN (2-4 sentences)
**Initiate**: [Start/stop/change what - specific drug and dose]
**Monitor**: [Labs, imaging, safety checks - with timing]
**Follow-up**: [When to reassess - specific timeframe]
**Escalate if**: [Red flags requiring change in management]
`;

export const THERAPY_HIERARCHY_RULES = `
**THERAPY HIERARCHY RULES (CRITICAL):**

1. **Always Order by Strength**:
   - First-line: Guideline-preferred therapy
   - Second-line: When first-line cannot be used
   - Not Recommended: Explicitly state inadequate options

2. **Tie Each Therapy to 4 Elements**:
   - Indication (who gets it)
   - Key Benefit (what outcome it improves)
   - Key Harm (major risk to monitor)
   - Evidence (guideline or major trial)

3. **Explicitly State When Options Are Inadequate**:
   - "Aspirin alone is NOT recommended as alternative to anticoagulation in AF"
   - "Dual antiplatelet therapy is NOT a substitute for anticoagulation"
   - "Monotherapy with [X] is insufficient for [condition]"

4. **Separate Class from Specific Drug**:
   - Class: "DOACs are first-line"
   - Specific: "Apixaban 5mg BID, rivaroxaban 20mg daily, etc."

5. **Include Non-Drug Options**:
   - Procedures: LAAO, ablation, surgery
   - Devices: Pacemaker, ICD, LVAD
   - Lifestyle: Weight loss, exercise, dietary changes
`;

export const POPULATION_SPECIFICITY_RULES = `
**POPULATION SPECIFICITY (CRITICAL):**

1. **Always State Population Clearly**:
   - ✅ "Non-valvular AF with CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥2"
   - ❌ "Atrial fibrillation patients"

2. **Don't Over-Generalize from Trials**:
   - If trial was in subclinical AF, don't claim it applies to all AF
   - If trial excluded CKD 4-5, acknowledge limitation

3. **Distinguish Contraindications**:
   - **Absolute**: Mechanical valve for DOACs, severe renal impairment
   - **Relative**: High bleeding risk, recent surgery
   - **Practical**: Cost, adherence, monitoring access

4. **Address Special Populations**:
   - Elderly (≥75 years)
   - Renal impairment (CKD 3-5)
   - Pregnancy/breastfeeding
   - Frailty
   - Multiple comorbidities
`;

export const CLINICAL_LINT_CHECKLIST = `
**CLINICAL LINT CHECKLIST (Auto-Check Before Finalizing):**

Before submitting answer, verify:
- [ ] Drug/device mentioned WITH indication (who gets it)
- [ ] Therapy recommended WITH at least one risk/monitoring mention
- [ ] No "aspirin/antiplatelet instead of anticoagulation" in AF
- [ ] No claims of "cure" or "no risk"
- [ ] Population clearly stated (not over-generalized)
- [ ] Specific doses provided (not just drug names)
- [ ] Monitoring plan included (labs, timing, follow-up)
- [ ] "Not Recommended" section included if relevant
- [ ] Contraindications distinguished (absolute vs relative)
- [ ] Special populations addressed if relevant

**EXAMPLE: AF + Warfarin Contraindication**

## Quick Answer
For patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and warfarin contraindication, initiate a Direct Oral Anticoagulant (DOAC) as first-line stroke prevention[[1]](url). If all oral anticoagulants are contraindicated, consider Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion (LAAO) after specialist evaluation[[2]](url).

## Core Therapy Hierarchy

**First-Line Therapy: Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs)**
- **Indication**: Non-valvular AF with CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥2 (or ≥1 for women), warfarin contraindicated
- **Key Benefit**: 60% reduction in stroke/systemic embolism vs placebo (NNT ~50/year), non-inferior to warfarin[[3]](url)
- **Key Harm**: Major bleeding 1-3%/year, requires renal function monitoring[[4]](url)
- **Evidence**: RE-LY, ROCKET-AF, ARISTOTLE, ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trials; 2023 ACC/AHA/ESC AF Guidelines[[1]](url)
- **Specific Regimens**:
  - Apixaban 5mg BID (or 2.5mg BID if ≥2 criteria: age ≥80, weight ≤60kg, Cr ≥1.5)
  - Rivaroxaban 20mg daily (15mg if CrCl 30-49)
  - Dabigatran 150mg BID (110mg BID if age ≥80 or high bleeding risk)
  - Edoxaban 60mg daily (30mg if CrCl 30-50, weight ≤60kg, or P-gp inhibitors)

**Second-Line: Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion (LAAO)**
- **Indication**: CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥3 with contraindication to ALL oral anticoagulants
- **Key Benefit**: Non-inferior to warfarin in selected patients (PROTECT-AF, PREVAIL trials)[[5]](url)
- **Key Harm**: Procedural complications 2-5%, device-related thrombus, requires short-term anticoagulation
- **Evidence**: 2023 ESC AF Guidelines for selected high-risk patients[[2]](url)

**Not Recommended**:
- **Aspirin monotherapy**: NOT a substitute for anticoagulation in AF (minimal stroke reduction ~20%, bleeding risk remains)[[6]](url)
- **Dual antiplatelet therapy** (aspirin + clopidogrel): Inferior to anticoagulation for stroke prevention, similar bleeding risk[[7]](url)

## Key Clarifications

1. **DOAC Contraindications**:
   - **Absolute**: Mechanical heart valve, severe mitral stenosis, CrCl <15 mL/min (or <30 for some DOACs)
   - **Relative**: Active bleeding, recent major surgery, thrombocytopenia <50k
   - **Practical**: Cost, adherence concerns, lack of reversal agent access

2. **Renal Function Monitoring**:
   - Check CrCl before starting DOAC
   - Recheck every 6-12 months (more frequently if CKD 3b or worse)
   - Dose-adjust based on CrCl thresholds (drug-specific)

3. **Elderly Patients (≥75 years)**:
   - DOACs preferred over warfarin (50% lower intracranial hemorrhage risk)[[8]](url)
   - Consider dose reduction for apixaban/dabigatran based on age + other factors
   - Assess fall risk, but don't withhold anticoagulation solely due to falls

4. **Bridging NOT Needed**:
   - DOACs reach therapeutic levels within 2-4 hours
   - No heparin bridging required when starting DOAC
   - For procedures: stop DOAC 24-48h before (based on CrCl and bleeding risk)

5. **When to Refer to Specialist**:
   - LAAO evaluation (interventional cardiology/electrophysiology)
   - Recurrent stroke despite anticoagulation
   - Complex drug interactions or multiple comorbidities

## Clinical Plan

**Initiate**: Start apixaban 5mg BID (or 2.5mg BID if dose-reduction criteria met) for stroke prevention. Educate patient on bleeding signs (unusual bruising, blood in stool/urine, severe headache).

**Monitor**: 
- Renal function (CrCl) at baseline, 3 months, then every 6-12 months
- CBC at baseline and if bleeding symptoms develop
- Assess adherence and bleeding events at each visit

**Follow-up**: Review in 4-6 weeks to assess tolerance, adherence, and any bleeding events. Reassess stroke and bleeding risk annually using CHA₂DS₂-VASc and HAS-BLED scores.

**Escalate if**: 
- Major bleeding event → Stop DOAC, consider reversal agent (idarucizumab for dabigatran, andexanet alfa for Xa inhibitors), evaluate for LAAO
- Recurrent stroke despite adherence → Neurology consult, consider imaging for other causes (carotid stenosis, PFO)
- CrCl declines to <30 mL/min → Adjust dose or consider alternative strategy

## Summary
For non-valvular AF with warfarin contraindication, DOACs are first-line therapy with excellent efficacy and safety. LAAO is reserved for patients who cannot tolerate any oral anticoagulant. Aspirin and antiplatelet therapy are NOT adequate alternatives.

## References
[8-12 references with proper formatting]

## Follow-Up Questions
1. What are the specific reversal strategies for each DOAC in case of major bleeding?
2. How should DOAC therapy be managed perioperatively for patients undergoing elective surgery?
3. What is the role of left atrial appendage occlusion in patients with high bleeding risk but not absolute contraindications to anticoagulation?
