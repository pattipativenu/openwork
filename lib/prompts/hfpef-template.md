# HFpEF Response Template (OpenEvidence Style)

## Target Response Structure for HFpEF Queries

### Opening Paragraph (Evidence-Based Foundation)
According to [recent NEJM review/major guideline], the evidence-based approach to managing **heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in elderly patients** begins with [specific diagnostic criteria/exclusions]. The mainstays of therapy are **[primary therapy]** for [specific indication] and **[secondary therapy]** to [specific outcome]; [specific continuation guidance].

### Clinical Recommendations Paragraph  
No current therapy has demonstrated a mortality benefit in this population, so the primary goals are to [specific goals]. In patients with both HFpEF and [comorbidity], **[specific therapy]** may be considered to [specific outcomes]. The review emphasizes that management should be individualized, focusing on [specific approach], as the syndrome is [specific characteristics] in elderly patients.

### Detailed Management Paragraph
Building on the initial principles, the evidence-based management emphasizes [specific approach]. The [specific guidelines with year] recommend **[specific intervention]** to [specific targets] (typically [specific values]). **[Primary drug class]**, such as [specific drugs with doses], are now considered first-line pharmacologic therapy for HFpEF, as they have demonstrated [specific outcomes] in [specific trials] and are endorsed by [specific organizations].

### Additional Therapies Paragraph
For patients with [specific criteria], **[additional therapies]** may be considered, particularly in those with [specific characteristics], although the benefit is [qualification] and patient selection is important. [Specific therapy] remains essential for **[specific indication]** in patients with [specific condition], with [specific guidance]. Non-pharmacologic interventions, including **[specific interventions]**, have shown [specific outcomes] in [specific populations].

### Contraindications/Cautions Paragraph
Management of comorbidities—such as [specific conditions]—should be optimized according to current best practices, as these conditions frequently coexist and contribute to [specific impacts]. Importantly, therapies such as [specific therapies] should be avoided unless there is a compelling [specific indication], as they have not demonstrated benefit and may [specific harms] in this population. Regular [specific monitoring] are recommended to [specific goals].

## Key Elements to Include

### Specific Guidelines to Cite
