OpenWork is a **research synthesis tool** specifically designed for healthcare professionals who need rapid access to high-quality medical evidence. It transforms hours of manual literature review into seconds of intelligent synthesis, acting as a research assistant that finds relevant articles from high-quality publications and circulations to provide summarized answers with inline citations.

## 🎯 **What is OpenWork AI?**

OpenWork AI is designed to save time for health professionals by automating the discovery and analysis of medical literature. It acts on behalf of clinicians to find the most relevant research and synthesize it into a grounded, evidence-first response.

### **🚫 What OpenWork AI is NOT:**
- ❌ **Not a diagnostic tool** - It does not diagnose medical conditions.
- ❌ **Not a treatment recommendation engine** - It does not provide clinical recommendations or prescribe treatments.
- ❌ **Not clinical decision support** - It does not replace the professional judgment of a healthcare provider.
- ❌ **Not patient-facing** - Designed strictly for professional and educational use.

### **✅ What OpenWork AI IS:**
- ✅ **Research Synthesis Platform** - Finds and analyzes peer-reviewed medical publications.
- ✅ **Evidence-First Assistant** - Every claim is backed by inline citations to authoritative sources.
- ✅ **Time-Saving Infrastructure** - Reduces research time from hours to under 60 seconds.
- ✅ **Educational Resource** - Features a deep-learning "Study Mode" for clinicians and students.

## 🤖 **The 7-Agent System Detailed**

OpenWork AI operates through a sophisticated **7-agent system** powered by **Gemini 3.0** models. Each agent is specialized for a distinct stage of the research synthesis pipeline.

### **Agent 1: Query Intelligence**
- **Model**: `gemini-3.0-flash-preview`
- **Purpose**: Analyzes raw natural language to extract medical entities and generate specialized search variants.
- **Function**: Abbreviation expansion, intent classification, and routing to sub-agents.

### **Agent 2: Multi-Source Retrieval Coordinator**
![OpenWork AI Multi-Source Retrieval Coordinator](https://storage.googleapis.com/openwork-images/mermaid-diagram%20(sub-agents).png)
- **Technology**: Python Async Orchestrator
- **Purpose**: Coordinates parallel evidence collection.
- **Sub-Agents (2.1 to 2.5)**:
  - **2.1: Guidelines Retriever**: Vector search across Indian clinical practice guidelines (Powered by **Gemini 3 Flash**).
  - **2.2: PubMed Intelligence**: Advanced query building with MeSH term mapping (Powered by **Gemini 3 Flash**).
  - **2.3: Full-Text Fetcher**: Retrieves structured content from PMC and open-access PDFs (Powered by **Gemini 3 Flash**).
  - **2.4: DailyMed Retriever**: Extracts safety, dosing, and warning sections from FDA labels (Powered by **Gemini 3 Flash**).
  - **2.5: Tavily Smart Search**: On-demand search for recent literature (Powered by **Gemini 3 Flash**).

### **Agent 3: Evidence Normalizer**
- **Purpose**: Standardizes data from multiple formats (XML, HTML, JSON) into a unified structure.
- **Function**: Deduplication across search variants and sources.

### **Agent 4: BGE Reranker**
- **Model**: `BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3`
- **Purpose**: Precision ranking of evidence relevance.
- **Process**: Scores 100+ documents/chunks to find the top 10 most grounded evidence segments.

### **Agent 5: Evidence Gap Analyzer**
- **Model**: `gemini-3.0-pro-exp`
- **Purpose**: Evaluates evidence coverage and identifies missing elements (recency, quality gaps).
- **Function**: Conditionally triggers Agent 2.5 if gaps are detected.

### **Agent 6: Synthesis Engine**
- **Model**: `gemini-3.0-pro-exp` (Complex) or `gemini-3.0-flash-preview` (Simple)
- **Purpose**: Generates the final research synthesis or interactive study materials.
- **Function**: Handles contradictions explicitly and ensures every claim has an inline citation [N].

### **Agent 7: Verification Gate**
- **Model**: `gemini-3.0-flash-preview`
- **Purpose**: Final anti-hallucination verification.
- **Function**: Performs semantic grounding checks to ensure the synthesis matches the source text.
